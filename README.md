# Trump-Tweets
We live in a digital world that is ever-changing, from the sources of our information, to the credibility we place in various online mediums, and the ease and patterns of disseminating information. Online text is incredibly powerful. Furthermore, social media is ubiquitous, and Twitter alone produces, on average, 500 million tweets a day. Individual tweets can have a profound effect. Another global trend is that the political landscape is becoming increasingly polarizing. Within the United States, we are experiencing a unique period in history. To this end, tweets, especially political ones, are influential and ripe for analysis. Throughout the past four years, President Donald Trump has often tweeted about both market-related and nonrelated topics. In this project, we sought to discover a relationship between intraday CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) / S&amp;P 500 data and President Trump's tweets from January 2016 to November 2019.
